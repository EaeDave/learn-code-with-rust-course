In the src folder, run rustc main.rs.
Then, the rust compiler will generate the main.exe (In Windows) or main (For MacOS or Linux)
Using cargo build or a shortcut (cargo b) (debug standard mode to compile) all the project is compiled in target/debug
Adding --release flag after cargo b or cargo build, then the output will be smaller in target/release (removing debugging metadata)
Release should be the final stage to the product
The command cargo clean will delete all compiled stuffs (all target folder)

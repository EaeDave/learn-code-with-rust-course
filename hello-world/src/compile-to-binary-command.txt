In the src folder, run rustc main.rs.
Then, the rust compiler will generate the main.exe (In Windows) or main (For MacOS or Linux)
Using cargo build or a shortcut (cargo b) (debug standard mode to compile) all the project is compiled in target/debug
Adding --release flag after cargo b or cargo build, then the output will be smaller in target/release (removing debugging metadata)
Release should be the final stage to the product
The command cargo clean will delete all compiled stuffs (all target folder)
Using cargo run (build the executable and run after that, compile)
Using cargo run --quiet, it removes all debugging in console output
It's possible to shortcut using cargo r
The command cargo check, don't build (compile) the project, but instead verify if there is something wrong with the code
And cargo check is faster than run or build, cause don't need to create the binary (used often when acessing coding with ssh if needed)
